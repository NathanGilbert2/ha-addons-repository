## 1.1.0

### 🚀 Improvements

- Expects scripts are now wrapped in their own files
- `run.sh` entrypoint is more clever, and now calls only needed scripts
- ProtonMail Bridge output is hidden. Only relevant information is
   displayed. This is thanks to expect scripts.
- Add a `debug.sh` file which is used only when developing to interact
  with expect scripts.
- Logs are using utility functions from bashio. The date format displays
  the current date and has a millisecond resolution.
